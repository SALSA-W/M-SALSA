# SALSA
Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is an important problem of bioinformatics. Its purpose is to find relationships among residues of biological sequences connected by an evolutionary, structural or functional relationship. SALSA (Sequence Alignment by Local Search Algorithm) is a stochastic local search algorithm for solving MSA.
