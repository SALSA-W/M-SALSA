# M-SALSA
Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is an important problem of bioinformatics.
Its purpose is to find relationships among residues of biological sequences connected by an evolutionary, structural or functional relationship. 
**M-SALSA (Multiple Sequence Alignment by Local Search Algorithm)** is a stochastic local search algorithm for solving MSA.
