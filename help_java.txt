=== COMMANDS ===
# Help
To get the list of all commands you could use the help command:
java -jar msalsa-cli.jar -help

# Mandatory parameters:
-inputFile
    path of a file containing the initial alignment.
-outputFile
    path of the output file. This will be in FASTA format

# Other Mandatory parameters (choice)
##Option 1: Provide guide tree
This option requires that input file must be in FASTA format. For more informations about FASTA see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format

-phTreeFile
    file containing the guide tree, used by M-SALSA in order to generate correct weigths for the WSP-Score. The file must be in Newicks format

##Option 2: Generated guide tree and pre-alignment
This M-SALSA version could call Clustal and perform the pre-alignment and guide tree required from M-SALSA.
This permit to avoid the input of -phTreeFile because this data is generated using Clustal.
This approach permit to give and input different from FASTA, but accepted from Clustal: NBRF/PIR, EMBL/UniProt, Pearson (FASTA), GDE, ALN/Clustal, GCG/MSF, RSF (see the Clustal help pages for details about formats).

-clustal
    define what version of Clustal must be uses for perform the pre-alignment. Possible values:
        CLUSTAL_O: ClustalOmega (default value)
        CLUSTAL_W: ClustalW2
-clustalPath
    define the path where clustal program is available. The clustal programs are available at ClustalOmega and ClustalW2
-clustalWPath
    define path where ClustalW2 program is installed. Required for generate tree file
-generatePhTree
    define if the phylogenetic neighbour-joining tree file must be generated. Requires ClustalW2 path defined. Could be set using -clustalWPath or using ClustalW2 for the alignment	

# Optional parameters:
-GOP
    GAP Opening Penalty (default 8)
-GEP
    GAP Extension Penalty (default 5)
-gamma
    dimension of the range of positions a GAP can move in during an iteration (default 30)
-type
    type of sequences. Possible options are DNA, RNA and PROTEINS (default PROTEINS)
-scoringMatrix
    scoring matrix (default BLOSUM62). Available matrices are: BLOSUM30, BLOSUM45, BLOSUM50, BLOSUM62, BLOSUM80, IUB, PAM20, PAM60, PAM120, PAM350.
-scoringMatrixPath
    scoring matrix file. For more information on scoring matrix file format visit M-SALSA wiki
-matrixSerie
    matrix serie. Possible options: BLOSUM or PAM (default BLOSUM)
-distanceMatrix
    distance matrix file
-minIt
    minimum number of iterations (default 1000)
-pSplit
    probability of split (default 0.1)
-terminal
    the strategy to be used to manage terminal GAPs. Possible values:
        ONLY_GEP: GOP=0 only for terminal GAPs (default value)
        BOTH: both opening and extension penalty for terminal GAPs

=== EXAMPLES ===
# Example constants
For the examples we define some common constants:
* <input_file_path>: full path to the input file with sequences to process
* <input_tree_file_path>: full path of input file with phylogenetic tree
* <output_file_path>: full path of desired output file
* <clustal_w_path>: full path to ClustalW2 program available from http://www.clustal.org/clustal2/
* <clustal_o_path>: full path to Clustal Omega program available from http://www.clustal.org/omega/

# Example of constants value
## Windows
* <input_file_path> = "C:\Users\username\Documents\SALSA\input.txt"
* <input_tree_file_path> = "C:\Users\username\Documents\SALSA\input.dnd"
* <output_file_path> = "C:\Users\username\Documents\SALSA\output.fasta"
* <clustal_w_path> = "C:\Program Files (x86)\ClustalW2\clustalw2.exe"
* <clustal_o_path> = "C:\Program Files (x86)\clustal-omega\clustalo.exe"

## Linux
* <input_file_path> = "/home/username/Documents/SALSA/input.txt"
* <input_tree_file_path> = "/home/username/Documents/SALSA/input.dnd"
* <output_file_path> = "/home/username/Documents/SALSA/output.fasta"
* <clustal_w_path> = "/home/username/clustal/clustalw/clustalw2"
* <clustal_o_path> = "/home/username/clustal/clustalo"

# Examples:
## Input in FASTA format alredy processed from other aligment alghorim
The input for this examples must be already processed by other alghorims.


java -jar msalsa-cli.jar -inputFile <input_file_path> -outputFile <output_file_path> -phTreeFile <input_tree_file_path>

M-SALSA will improve input aligment and produce the output aligment in the desired file.

## ClustalW and ClustalOmega Installed

java -jar msalsa-cli.jar -inputFile <input_file_path> -outputFile <output_file_path> -clustalPath <clustal_o_path>

M-SALSA will use ClustalOmega to perform the pre-aligment. 
M-SALSA will then improve alignment and produce the output alignment in the desired file.


java -jar msalsa-cli.jar -inputFile <input_file_path> -outputFile <output_file_path> -clustalPath <clustal_o_path> -generatePhTree -clustalWPath <clustal_w_path>

M-SALSA will use ClustalOmega to perform the pre-aligment. 
M-SALSA will then improve alignment and produce the output alignment in the desired file.
Using ClustalW2 the phylogenetic neighbour-joining tree will be generated from the output M-SALSA aligment. 

## Only ClustalW Installed

java -jar msalsa-cli.jar -inputFile <input_file_path> -outputFile <output_file_path> -clustalPath <clustal_w_path>

This example requires that the input <clustal_w_path> process name must be "clustalw2". From input given the other data are implicitly understood.
M-SALSA will use ClustalW2 to perform the pre-aligment. 
M-SALSA will then improve alignment and produce the output alignment in the desired file.


java -jar msalsa-cli.jar -inputFile <input_file_path> -outputFile <output_file_path> -clustalPath <clustal_w_path> -clustal CLUSTAL_W

M-SALSA will use ClustalW2 to perform the pre-aligment. 
M-SALSA will then improve alignment and produce the output alignment in the desired file.


java -jar msalsa-cli.jar -inputFile <input_file_path> -outputFile <output_file_path> -clustalPath <clustal_w_path> -generatePhTree

This example requires that the input <clustal_w_path> process name must be "clustalw2". From input given the other data are implicitly understood.
M-SALSA will use ClustalW2 to perform the pre-aligment.
