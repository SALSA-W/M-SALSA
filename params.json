{"name":"M-SALSA","tagline":"M-SALSA (Sequence Alignment by Local Search Algorithm) is a local search algorithm for solving Multiple Sequence Alignment","body":"## What is M-SALSA?\r\n[Multiple sequence alignment (MSA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sequence_alignment) is an important problem in bioinformatics. Its purpose is to find relationships among residues of biological sequences connected by an evolutionary, structural or functional relationship.\r\n\r\n**M-SALSA** (Sequence Alignment by Local Search Algorithm) is a stochastic local search algorithm that improves alignments generated by other MSA programs.\r\n\r\nTwo versions of M-SALSA are available: one implemented using c++ and the other using java.\r\nIt is also available a web application that gives an easier user experience. It automatically calls an external program that calculates the initial alignment to be enhanced by M-SALSA. \r\n\r\n## How to install\r\nFor install instructions visit [M-SALSA wiki](https://github.com/SALSA-W/M-SALSA/wiki).\r\n\r\n## Contribution\r\nTo report a bug or suggest an enhancement visit [M-SALSA issue tracker](https://github.com/SALSA-W/M-SALSA/issues).\r\n\r\n## Command line usage\r\n# c++ version\r\n\r\n# java version \r\n\r\n## License\r\nCopyright 2015 Alessandro Daniele, Fabio Cesarato, Andrea Giraldin\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n\r\n[![License](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-APACHE2-blue.svg)](https://github.com/SALSA-W/M-SALSA/blob/master/LICENSE)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
