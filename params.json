{"name":"M-SALSA","tagline":"M-SALSA (Sequence Alignment by Local Search Algorithm) is a local search algorithm for solving Multiple Sequence Alignment","body":"### What is M-SALSA?\r\n[Multiple sequence alignment (MSA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sequence_alignment) is an important problem in bioinformatics. Its purpose is to find relationships among residues of biological sequences connected by an evolutionary, structural or functional relationship.\r\n\r\nM-SALSA (Sequence Alignment by Local Search Algorithm) is a stochastic local search algorithm that improves alignments generated by other MSA programs.\r\n\r\nTwo versions of M-SALSA are available: one implemented using c++ and the other using java.\r\nIt is also available a web application that gives an easier user experience. It automatically calls an external program that calculates the initial alignment to be enhanced by M-SALSA. \r\n\r\n### How to install\r\nFor install instructions visit [M-SALSA wiki](https://github.com/SALSA-W/M-SALSA/wiki).\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
