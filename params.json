{"name":"M-SALSA","tagline":"M-SALSA (Sequence Alignment by Local Search Algorithm) is a local search algorithm for solving Multiple Sequence Alignment","body":"# What is M-SALSA?\r\n[Multiple sequence alignment (MSA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sequence_alignment) is an important problem in bioinformatics. Its purpose is to find relationships among residues of biological sequences connected by an evolutionary, structural or functional relationship.\r\n\r\n**M-SALSA** (Sequence Alignment by Local Search Algorithm) is a stochastic local search algorithm that improves alignments generated by other MSA programs.\r\n\r\nTwo versions of M-SALSA are available: one implemented using c++ and the other using java.\r\nIt is also available a web application that gives an easier user experience. It automatically calls an external program that calculates the initial alignment to be enhanced by M-SALSA. \r\n\r\n# How to install\r\nFor install instructions visit [M-SALSA wiki](https://github.com/SALSA-W/M-SALSA/wiki).\r\n\r\n# Contribution\r\nTo report a bug or suggest an enhancement visit [M-SALSA issue tracker](https://github.com/SALSA-W/M-SALSA/issues).\r\n\r\n# Command line usage\r\n## c++ version\r\nIn order to use M-SALSA command line version on linux you must use this sintax:\r\n` ./M-SALSA input_file output_file guide_tree_file [OPTIONS]`\r\nOn windows the command is the same except you have to replace `./M-SALSA` with `M-SALSA.exe`:\r\n` M-SALSA.exe input_file output_file guide_tree_file [OPTIONS]`\r\n\r\n### Mandatory parameters\r\n* input_file:      path of a file containing the initial alignment. The file must be in [FASTA format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format)\r\n* output_file:     path of the output file. This will be in FASTA format as well\r\n* guide_tree_file: file containing the guide tree, used by M-SALSA in order to generate correct weigths for the WSP-Score (link). The file must be in [Newicks format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format)\r\n\r\n***\r\n### Optional parameters:\r\n* -GOP:            GAP Opening Penalty (default 8)\r\n* -GEP:            GAP Extension Penalty (default 5)\r\n* -gamma:          dimension of the range of positions a GAP can move in during an iteration (default 30)\r\n* -type:           type of sequences. Possible options are DNA, RNA and PROTEINS (default PROTEINS)\r\n* -scoringMatrix:  scoring matrix file (default BLOSUM62). For more information on scoring matrix file format visit [M-SALSA wiki](https://github.com/SALSA-W/M-SALSA/wiki)\r\n* -matrixSerie:    matrix serie. Possible options: BLOSUM or PAM (default BLOSUM)\r\n* -distanceMatrix: distance matrix file\r\n* -minIt:          minimum number of iterations (default 1000)\r\n* -pSplit:         probability of split (default 0.1)\r\n* -terminal:       the strategy to be used to manage terminal GAPs. Possible values:\r\n                   1. ONLY_GEP: GOP=0 only for terminal GAPs (default)\r\n                   2. BOTH: both opening and extension penalty for terminal GAPs\r\n\r\n### Substitution matrix choice:\r\nIf no optional parameters are provided M-SALSA default substitution matrix is BLOSUM62. In order to work, the file containing such a matrix should be placed in the folder where M-SALSA executable is. If user specifies the type parameter, the default matrix is chosen according to it. For PROTEINS the default matrix is still BLOSUM62, for DNA it is IUB, for RNA no default matrix exists. Therefore, if input consists on RNA sequences user must provide a substitution matrix.\r\n\r\nIn case of PROTEINS type it is also possible to specify a distance matrix, a matrix containing the distance between each couple of sequences in the alignment. M-SALSA uses such a matrix to automatically infer the correct substitution matrix. The chosen matrix depends also an the matrixSerie parameter, that can be BLOSUM or PAM (if not specified it will use a BLOSUM matrix). As with the default substitution matrixes, this can work only if the substitution matrixes files provided with source code of M-SALSA are inside M-SALSA executable folder.\r\n\r\n## java version \r\n\r\n# License\r\nCopyright 2015 Alessandro Daniele, Fabio Cesarato, Andrea Giraldin\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n\r\n[![License](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-APACHE2-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SALSA-W/M-SALSA/master/LICENSE)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Support or Contact","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
